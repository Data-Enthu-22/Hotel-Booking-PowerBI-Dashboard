## Project Name: Hotel-Booking-PowerBI-Dashboard
## Project Description:
### Objective:
This project aimed to create a Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize hotel booking data. The dashboard provides key insights into booking trends, customer behavior, revenue, and hotel performance. By combining data from various sources, such as reservations, customer demographics, and room availability, the dashboard empowers hotel managers to make data-driven decisions for improving operations and maximizing profitability.
Scope:
•	Aggregating and visualizing data related to hotel bookings, occupancy rates, room types, and customer demographics.
•	Creating interactive visualizations that allow users to explore and filter booking data by date, location, customer profile, and booking source.
•	Generating actionable insights for sales, marketing, and operations teams to improve the guest experience and increase booking rates.
Key Findings:
1.	Booking Trends:
o	There was a seasonal peak in bookings, with the highest bookings recorded during the summer months and holiday seasons.
o	Weekdays generally had lower occupancy rates, whereas weekends saw a spike in bookings, especially for business hotels.
2.	Revenue Analysis:
o	The average revenue per booking was highest for luxury rooms but the occupancy rate was low. Meanwhile, economy rooms showed higher occupancy but generated less revenue.
o	Discounted bookings (e.g., via promotional campaigns) had a significant increase in volume, but the profit margins were considerably lower.
3.	Customer Demographics:
o	Most bookings came from young professionals (ages 25-40), particularly those booking for business trips.
o	International tourists made up a significant portion of the customer base for beach and resort hotels, while domestic travelers preferred city-center hotels.
4.	Source of Bookings:
o	The majority of bookings were made through online travel agencies (OTAs), with a smaller but growing segment of direct bookings through the hotel’s website.
o	Mobile app bookings were growing in popularity, particularly for last-minute reservations.
5.	Room Type Performance:
o	Deluxe and luxury suites had high booking rates but a lower conversion rate compared to mid-range options. Upsell opportunities existed for converting lower-tier bookings into premium rooms.
o	Family and suite rooms were preferred by families traveling together, whereas single rooms were often booked by solo travelers and business customers.
### Insights:
1.	Seasonal Patterns:
The seasonality in booking trends indicates the potential for optimized pricing strategies. Pricing can be adjusted based on the season to maximize revenue during peak times while attracting customers during off-peak periods with discounts.
2.	Revenue vs. Occupancy:
The gap between luxury room occupancy and revenue per booking suggests that while premium rooms are highly profitable, their low occupancy might indicate pricing is too high or not effectively marketed to the right customer segment. This could be a focus area for promotional strategies.
3.	Customer Segmentation:
Understanding the demographics of the booking customers is crucial for targeting the right audiences. Young professionals book frequently, particularly for business trips, which suggests there’s an opportunity for tailored offerings, such as business packages or loyalty programs.
4.	Booking Channel Insights:
Heavy reliance on OTAs for bookings suggests that the hotel might not be maximizing its own booking platform’s potential. This can lead to higher commissions to third-party platforms and may impact profit margins.
5.	Upselling Opportunities:
High-end room types (e.g., luxury suites) have a lower conversion rate. By offering upgrades at the time of booking or during check-in, hotels can increase average revenue per guest.
### Recommendations:
1.	Optimize Pricing Strategy:
o	Introduce dynamic pricing based on demand and seasonality. For example, increase room rates during peak seasons (holidays, summer) and offer discounts or early-bird promotions during off-peak months.
o	Implement discount strategies for higher-end rooms to increase occupancy while maintaining profitability.
2.	Focus on Direct Bookings:
o	Promote direct bookings through the hotel’s website or mobile app by offering exclusive discounts or special deals that are not available on OTAs.
o	Improve the user experience on the booking site or app, including fast booking features, personalized recommendations, and loyalty programs.
3.	Targeted Marketing Campaigns:
o	Leverage the data on customer demographics to create personalized marketing campaigns targeting specific segments. For example, offer tailored packages for business travelers, families, or international tourists.
o	Use data from mobile app bookings to enhance mobile marketing efforts, especially for last-minute deals..
4.	Mobile Booking Enhancement:
o	With the growing popularity of mobile app bookings, invest in improving the mobile experience, such as offering special mobile-only discounts, adding one-click booking features, and ensuring a seamless and intuitive interface.
